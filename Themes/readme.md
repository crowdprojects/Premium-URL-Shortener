We will start upload community themes here. (WHEN??? = I'm ready to startworking if anyone interested)

18th OCT 2020 - CAN WE START WOEKIG ON A BARE-BONES THEME WITH CODING TUTORIAL SO USERS CAN EXPAND ON THEME WITHOUT THE HELP OF A CODER OR HAVING TO USE THE LIMITED NUMBER (3-5 THEMES TOTAL FOR THIS SCRIPT AFTER 5YRS IS NOT ENOUGH, AND LACK OF TUTORIALS/INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MODIFY THEMES SHOULD BE WELL & TRULY UPDATED BY NOW = BEEN HEARING ABOUT DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR TWEAKS FOR YERS NOW! IE. WP PLUGIN WITH THIS API BUILT IN FOR EXAMPLE & HOW TO DO BASICS TO MAKE THEMES LOOK DIFFERENT TO EVERYONE ELSES EG. CHANGE LOGO SIZE, LAYOUT = Right side, Middle or Left side of Screen, Adding Social Media Links & Text Icons to Footers of Themes, for starters!)
I get questions ALL The Time for BASIS STUFF LIKE THIS, ON A SCRIPT AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS TO BUY, THE INSTRUCTIONS & TITORIALS ON ODIFICATIONS SHOULD BE "ADDED TO/UPDATED" MONTHLY & NEW THEMES ADDED EVERY MAJOR UPDATE ...ALSO WITH DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON MODIFICATION OF THEMES
